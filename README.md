# Web-Scraping-Script-python-
A Python script to scrape essential geographic and demographic data for countries, saving the results to a structured CSV file for analysis.


Project Goal:
The objective of this project is to reliably extract key country metrics—Name, Capital, Population, and Area—from a web source using the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries, providing a clean, ready-to-use dataset.

Features:
Web Scraping: Uses requests to fetch the HTML content of the target URL.

HTML Parsing: Leverages BeautifulSoup to navigate and extract data from the HTML table structure.

Data Export: Writes the collected data into a well-formatted CSV file (country_data.csv).

Clean Output: The resulting CSV includes the required columns: Country Name, Capital, Population, and Area.
