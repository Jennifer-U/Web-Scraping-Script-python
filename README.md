# Web Scraping Script - Python

A Python script that extracts essential geographic and demographic data (name, capital, population, and area) for countries from a web source. Uses `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries to scrape data and outputs a structured CSV file for analysis.

## Project Goal

Reliably extract and structure key country metrics into a clean, ready-to-use dataset.

## Features:

### Web Scraping: 
Uses requests to fetch the HTML content of the target URL.

### HTML Parsing: 
Leverages BeautifulSoup to navigate and extract data from the HTML table structure.

### Data Export: 
Writes the collected data into a well-formatted CSV file (output.csv).

### Clean Output: 
The resulting CSV includes the required columns: Country Name, Capital, Population, and Area.
